            I like to ride my bike because my body will get exercised.I also can ride my bike with my friends and talk about stuff.I can also travel on my bike quicker than I can on foot.I save energy on my bike more than I do on foot.It is also fun to ride down hills.The benifits of riding my bike is an increase in cardiovascular fitness, an increase in muscle strength and flexibility, improved joint mobility, decreased stress levels, improved posture and coordination, strengthened bones, decreased body fat levels, and a prevention or management of disease.My bike is made by the company Mongoose and I got it on Christmas by my parents.
